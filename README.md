Microbe-Microbe Interaction Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (mmGEM)

# Repository Contents
1) mmGEM.sbml:
    This file contains the genome-scale metabolic model of a microbial community consisting of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) system.

2) condition_specific_data.csv: 
    A CSV file containing condition-specific data for the microbial fuel cell (MFC) system under low organic loading rate (L-OLR) and high organic loading rate (H-OLR) conditions.

3) run_SteadyCom_simulation.m:
    This MATLAB script is designed to run the SteadyCom algorithm using the mmGEM model. SteadyCom calculates steady-state metabolic fluxes in microbial communities.
